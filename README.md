# Hi there developer!

We are very curious about your frontend skills. We would like to give you the following challenge.

In this repo you'll find a json file that contains data we want you to make a webpage with. We'd like to see a one column layout on mobile and on the larger screens a layout with three columns. You'll also find two designs you can use for the column items. Feel free to use whatever language or tools you think are suitable. Please provide us with a Github repo containing all files and instructions on how to install/build/view what you've created.

Good luck and have fun!
