# Hi there developer!

We are very curious about your frontend skills. To test them, we would like to give you the following challenge.

In this repo you'll find a JSON file that contains data we want you to make a webpage with. We would like to see a one column layout on mobile and on the larger screens a layout with three columns. You'll also find two designs you can use for the column items. Feel free to use whatever languages and tools you think are suitable. Please submit your page to a GitHub repository and provide us with a link to it. Make sure to include instructions on how to build and view your creation.

Good luck and have fun!
