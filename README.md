# Hi there developer!

We are very curious about your frontend skills and would like to give you the following challenge.

In this repo you'll find two designs and a JSON file that contains some data. We'd like you to turn these in to a website. 

## Guidelines

- Make it responsive
- Don't use any frameworks just plain HTML, CSS and Javascript
- Request the JSON with an http request

Please provide us with a Github repo containing all files and instructions on how to install/build/view what you've created.

Good luck and have fun!
