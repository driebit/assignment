#Hi there developer!

We are very curious about your frontend skills. We would like to give you the following challenge.

We have a json file which contains some data that we want you to make we webpage with. We would like to see a one colom layout on mobile and on the larger screens a layout with three coloms. We have provided you with two designs for the items that the json contains. You are free to use what kind of language you want. Please provide us with your github repo and make sure we can easily view it on our computers.

Good luck and have fun!
